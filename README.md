## Project description

- **Creating and Joining Classrooms**: Teachers can effortlessly create classrooms within DappClassroom and generate unique class codes. These codes serve as invitations for students to join their respective classrooms, ensuring a seamless onboarding process.

- **Announcements and Interactions**: DappClassroom enables effective communication between teachers and students through announcements. Teachers can post announcements, promoting interaction and engagement within the classroom. Students have the ability to reply to these announcements, facilitating dynamic discussions and fostering a collaborative learning environment. The chat functionality is built using the powerful Push Chat SDK, ensuring smooth and seamless communication.

- **Assignments and Submission**: Teachers can seamlessly assign tasks to students by providing them with documents, whether they are text-based or image-based. These assignment documents, along with other assignment data, are securely stored on IPFS. Students can easily access and view the assigned documents in their dashboard, ensuring clarity and convenience. After analyzing the assignment, students can submit their completed work with ease. The submission process triggers a marking event on the blockchain, indicating that the student has submitted the assignment. This process leverages the power of IPFS for file storage and ensures the integrity of the submitted work.

- **Grading and Feedback**: Once students have submitted their assignments, teachers have the ability to provide grades and constructive feedback. Teachers can access a dashboard where they can evaluate the assignments and assign marks accordingly. The grading process is transparent, ensuring fairness and accuracy in assessing student performance. After the teacher has assigned grades, students are promptly notified of their marks, allowing them to track their progress and make necessary improvements.

- **Class Meetings and Collaboration**: DappClassroom facilitates class meetings, enabling teachers to organize interactive sessions. Students can join these meetings and engage in fruitful discussions. The interface for class meetings is designed intuitively, incorporating the power of Huddle 01 to provide an immersive and seamless experience for participants.

DappClassroom promotes transparency and fairness by integrating blockchain technology into education. Through the secure storage capabilities of IPFS, Intuitive chats powered by Push, Clean & Simple video conferencing interface of Huddle 01, easy to remember & familiar ENS names & avatar and the transparent features of blockchain, students' work and academic records are securely stored and easily accessible along with great interaction with teacher.

## How it's Made

DappClassroom is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies that work together seamlessly to create an innovative and efficient decentralized education platform. Here are the details of the technologies utilized:

- **IPFS/Web3.storage**: DappClassroom leverages IPFS and Web3.storage for storing class data, assignment data, and student data. IPFS provides a distributed storage system that enables easy fetching and storing of large data. By utilizing IPFS, DappClassroom enhances reliability and transparency in data storage, ensuring secure and efficient access to important educational resources.

- **FVM**: The DappClassroom contract is deployed on the FVM, which harnesses the enormous power of Filecoin's decentralized storage network. FVM enhances the robustness and reliability of DappClassroom, ensuring that data remains secure and accessible for all users.

- **Push Protocol**: To facilitate announcements and replies within the main classroom, DappClassroom integrates the Push Chat SDK. This technology enables seamless and real-time communication between students and teachers through chat functionalities. The integration of the Push Chat SDK enhances the collaborative nature of DappClassroom and promotes effective communication among users.

- **Huddle 01**: DappClassroom incorporates Huddle 01 to provide an enhanced video conferencing experience. Huddle 01 enables interactive and immersive class meetings, fostering better interaction between students and teachers. By hosting online classes through their DappClassroom dashboard, users can seamlessly participate in video conferencing sessions, further enhancing the learning experience.

- **ENS**: To simplify user identification, DappClassroom utilizes ENS. Displaying abstract user addresses can be challenging for both students and teachers to recognize each other. By leveraging ENS, DappClassroom assigns easy-to-remember and familiar ENS names and avatars to users. This approach ensures that users can quickly recognize and interact with each other in a more intuitive manner.

- **Spheron**: DappClassroom is deployed on Spheron, that offers simplicity, speed, transparency, and trust. By leveraging Spheron's hosting capabilities, DappClassroom ensures seamless access to the platform, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **React.js** is used for building the UI along with Styled components and other suppoting UI libraries. Ethers.js is used for interacting with the smart contract. **Wagmi & Rainbow Kit** is used for wallet connection and user data management within the dapp.

The combination of all these technologies enables DappClassroom to deliver a secure, transparent, and efficient decentralized education platform. The integration of these technologies plays a vital role in creating a seamless user experience while promoting collaboration, communication, and reliable data storage. Throughout the development process, we leveraged sponsor technologies to optimize functionality and enhance the overall experience of DappClassroom.
